# My Health Record system

My Health Record system is the Australian Government's digital health record system that holds _My Health Record_. _My Health Recordis_ a secure online health record containing consumers' health information. The system aims to provide health care  professionals with access to key health information, e.g. listing medicines, allergies and key diagnoses; radiology andpathology test results. The system (previously named Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record) enables consumers to decide how to share information with any of their health care providers who are registered and connected to the system. The _My Health Record_ system operates under the Australian legislative framework:

* [_My Health Records Act 2012 (Cth)_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2019C00337)
* [_My Health Records Rule 2016 (Cth)_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2016C00607)

The Act establishes, inter alia, a privacy framework specifying which entities can collect, use and disclose certain information in the system and the penalties that can be imposed on improper collection, use and disclosure of this information. We can find the formal specification (from the legislation) and verification in Event-B of the _My Health Record_ regarding how consumers can control who access the information, and how the system adheres to such access: [here](model/). You can also find the implementation of the system and JUnit test cases: [here](implementation/).
